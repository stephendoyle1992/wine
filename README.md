# WineSuggest
HackED2019 Project - This is a project for the MLH's January 2019 HackEd. The project uses Google's Dialogflow to use the Google assistant and a Google home to give a recommendation of wine to a user given certain parameters. The recommendations come from a dataset that was sourced from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). The assistant sends a get request to a server written in golang and hosted via heroku.
